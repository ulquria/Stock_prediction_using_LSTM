# Stock_prediction_using_LSTM
In this project, the future stock prices of apple data are predicted using the LSTM Recurrent Neural Network.  The task is to predict stock prices for next 30 days, which is a time series problem. The LSTM model is very popular in time-series forecasting, and this is the reason why this model is chosen in this task. 

After importing the data ,preprocessing is done. in which Data is split into train test . After that dataset  is converted into matrix with 100 days timestep  and is fed into LSTM model and graphs are plotted for prediction of next 30 days .
